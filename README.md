# RESAMPLING DATA #
______

- took in data that was unclean, not trained, nor ready for any sort of processing. Read-In that data with Pandas language
converted to a _DataFrame_. 
- Split newly made _DataFrame_ into **training and Testing sets** to get the _DataFrame_ ready for _Scaling and Testing_ to get the **training and Testing sets** ready to run a _Simple Logistic Regression_
- Ran the _Simple Logistic Regression_
  1. fit the logistic regression classifier
  2. Calculate the balanced accuracy score
  3. Display a confusion matrix
  4. Print a imbalanced classification report.
 The simple logistic regression helps with determining outcomes bases on varibales. In this case we are using this method to determine the risk of Lending. I took the data to mak
